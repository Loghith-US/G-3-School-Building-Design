# G+3-School-Building-Design
In this project we designed a school building of G+3 floors with all the necessary rooms, labs, classes, bathrooms, and others. 
The Designing of the building was done by me (Loghith) in Solidworks 3D, with help from team members in creating rest of the project like PPT Presentation, Video, Project Description.
